# Our Mission

The sole mission of the Reality Collective is to simplify and accelerate XR and Unity development through a range of useful tools, components and services.

XR Development is hard enough without having to worry about how each provider or vendor "does things differently", through the Reality Toolkit and other projects, you build your project once (against the toolkit) and we handle the heavy lifting to "make it work" on all supported platforms.

Have a suggestion or feature you would like, they raise an issue on the respective project and we'll prioritise it for delivery, or you can even make a PR yourself to get it in faster.
