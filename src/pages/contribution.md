We are happy that you have chosen to contribute to the Reality Collective and its projects, we are a trully open community and support any contributions small or large. This simple guide was written to guide you throug the steps to contirbute code.

Alternatively, you can choose to support the Reality Collective and it's projects though GitHub sponsors (other options coming soon).

Please read this document completely before contributing.

## How To Contribute

All Reality Collective projects have `development` branch for daily development, released packages also have a `Main` branch for the current active release.  New features and fixes are always submitted to the `development` branch.

If you are looking for ways to help, you should start by looking at the "Help Wanted tasks" in each project, for example in the [Service Framework](https://github.com/realitycollective/com.realitycollective.service-framework/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Help+Wanted%22).  Please let us know if you plan to work on an issue so that others are not duplicating your work.

> !! An Issue should proceed any PR to outline the change (Unless it is minor or a documentation update), whether it is an actual bug report, a proposal for correction, or additional functionality.

The Reality Collective projects follow the standards [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html).  You should learn and be familiar with how to [use Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/), how to [create a fork of any Reality Collective project](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/), and how to [submit a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

After you submit a PR, the [Reality Collective build servers](https://github.com/realitycollective/com.realitycollective.service-framework/actions/) will build your changes and verify that all tests pass (CHeck the `Actions` tab for the respective project).  Project maintainers and contributors will review your changes and provide constructive feedback to improve your submission.

Once we are satisfied that your changes are good, we will merge your PR.
